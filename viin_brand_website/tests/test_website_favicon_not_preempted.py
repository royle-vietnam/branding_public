# Locks the behavioral contract of the favicon-branding fix: Viindoo branding on
# `website.favicon` must be supplied as a DATA-level DEFAULT (models/website.py
# `_default_brand_favicon`), and must NEVER pre-empt a website's own configured favicon by
# rewriting the rendered `<link rel="shortcut icon">` at the QWeb level.
#
# The defect this replaces (see the header comment above the `layout` template in
# views/website_templates.xml) was an
#     <xpath expr="//t[@t-set='x_icon']" position="replace">
# inheriting `website.layout`. `locate_node` (odoo/tools/template_inheritance.py) resolves an
# xpath to the FIRST document-order match in the combined arch, which is core website's own
# producer (website/views/website_templates.xml:120 -
# `<t t-set="x_icon" t-value="website.image_url(website, 'favicon')"/>`), so the replace destroyed
# it and hardcoded the brand path unconditionally, with no `or` guard - a customer who configured
# their own favicon could never serve it (AC-1 below). The fix moves branding to a field default
# instead, which only supplies a value when none exists yet, so a NEW website still starts branded
# (AC-2 below) without ever overriding a value the customer set.
#
# AC-1 grounding (Odoo 19.0 core; verified via odoo-semantic model_inspect against the checkout at
# /home/tran-ngoc-tuan/git/odoo_19.0/addons):
#   - website/views/website_templates.xml:120 sets `x_icon = website.image_url(website, 'favicon')`.
#   - website/models/website.py:1782 `image_url(self, record, field, size=None)` (confirmed present
#     via odoo-semantic model_inspect at 19.0) returns
#       '/web/image/%s/%s/%s%s?unique=%s' % (record._name, record.id, field, size, sha)
#     i.e. for a website with no explicit size: /web/image/website/<id>/favicon?unique=<7 hex>
#     (sha = hashlib.sha512(str(record.write_date)...).hexdigest()[:7]).
#   - web/views/webclient_templates.xml:23 renders it:
#       <link type="image/x-icon" rel="shortcut icon" t-att-href="x_icon or '/web/static/img/favicon.ico'"/>
#
# The production fix (models/website.py) is ALREADY PRESENT in this tree, so the RED proof here is
# confirm-by-toggle, not red-before-green code absence:
#   - Restoring the deleted `//t[@t-set='x_icon']` replace xpath into views/website_templates.xml's
#     `layout` template must turn WebsiteFaviconNotPreemptedTest red (the rendered href collapses to
#     the hardcoded brand path regardless of the website's own configured favicon).
#   - Reverting the `favicon` field default in models/website.py to core's own `_default_favicon`
#     must turn BrandedFaviconDefaultTest red (a new website would start with core's own icon).
