/**
 * viin_brand_common recolours the frontend theme palette (primary #7f4282), so
 * the core `website_background_colorpicker` tour no longer holds on the branded
 * stack: its custom-colour step targets a hard-coded swatch
 * `background-color:#65435C` (= rgb(101,67,92)) which the recoloured palette
 * never produces, and its following RGBA check asserts that exact rgb.
 *
 * Re-register the tour (force) with the custom-colour part adapted to whatever
 * the first custom swatch is on the branded palette, and relax only the
 * hard-coded custom-colour RGBA assertion into a pure check that the RGBA pane
 * rendered (a plain drop would leave a click step as the LAST step, and
 * web_tour ignores the action of a last step with a warning). The gradient
 * steps (a fixed preset, unaffected by branding) and their RGBA check are kept
 * intact, so the tour still exercises the colorpicker.
